    "For currency arbitrage problems, graphs are used to represent the data. Currencies are vertices, and exchange rates are edges. Since every currency should be exchangeable, the resulting graph is a complete directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find a cycle in this complete directed graph such that the product of the edge weights within the cycle exceeds 1.01, i.e. 1% arbitrage profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more catch in this specific problem: if arbitrage exists, we need to find the arbitrage that involves with the fewest transactions. Also, even if arbitrage exists but if the number of transactions required exceeds the number of currencies $n$, then we will not consider the solution at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the key to this question is we want to maximize the product of the edge weights along the cycle and in the meantime, minimize the number of edges that construct the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to find all-pairs shortest-path for a directed graph. Since the number of transactions is limited, we can modify the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find an all-pairs longest-path with at most $n$ edges."
